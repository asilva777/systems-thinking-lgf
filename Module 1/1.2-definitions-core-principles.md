# Definitions and Core Principles

## What is Systems Thinking?

A way to understand complex structures through their interactions and patterns.

### Core Principles:

- **Interconnectedness**: Everything is part of a system
- **Feedback Loops**: Systems respond to actions through reinforcing or balancing effects
- **Delays**: Effects of changes often appear later
- **Non-linearity**: Small changes can lead to large impacts and vice versa
