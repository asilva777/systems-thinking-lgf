# Financial Ecosystems and Interdependencies

LGUs are not isolated—they function within financial ecosystems involving:

- National transfers
- Internal revenue allocation (IRA)
- Local taxation
- Infrastructure investment

These parts interact. Changing one impacts the others. For example:

> Cutting spending may reduce services → leading to lower business activity → reducing tax revenue.
