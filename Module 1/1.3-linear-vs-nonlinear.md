# Linear vs. Non-Linear Thinking in LGU Finance

Traditional models assume linear cause-effect (e.g., more tax = more revenue). Systems thinking reveals:

- **Feedback-driven revenue shifts**
- **Behavioral loops** (e.g., tax evasion responses)
- **Delayed policy impacts**

Non-linear thinking captures the **complex dynamics of LGU finance** more accurately.
